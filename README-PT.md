# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2021 (PT)
This is the main repo for the course RES, taught at HEIG-VD in 2021. 

This is where you will find lecture notes, slides and some of the examples presented in the class. We will also keep links to the different repos used throughout the semester (for assignments).

## Upcoming deadlines

* Until Wednesday, **March 3rd at 1PM** (sharp), you must have had **2 pull requests accepted and merged** in the Chill repository.
* Read this carefully: the pull requests must have been merged, which means that **I must have had the time to review them**.
